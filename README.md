# Power BI Virtual Case Experience

I was involved in several significant tasks in this Virtual Case Experience utilizing Power BI

‚ú®Call Centre Trends :

Firstly, I created a dynamic Power BI dashboard that showcased vital performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to call center trends. This involved creatively presenting information such as overall customer satisfaction, call volumes over time, average speed of answer, and agent performance quadrant analysis. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I was able to provide Claire and other stakeholders with a visually engaging and informative dashboard that facilitated data-driven decision-making.

‚ú® Customer Retention :

Furthermore, I took on the challenge of developing a dashboard focused on customer retention. This task was vital as the Retention Manager from a prominent telecom company contacted me directly, impressed by my previous work. Through in-depth analysis and visualization, I provided valuable insights into customer churn and identified potential strategies to enhance customer retention. Additionally, I facilitated a meeting between the Retention Manager and the engagement partner at PwC, where we discussed proactive measures to identify customers at risk of termination and optimize retention efforts.

‚ú® Diversity and Inclusion : 

Another aspect of this project involved addressing diversity and inclusion challenges within the organization's human resources department. Recognizing the importance of diverse talent and inclusive workplace environments, I worked closely with HR teams to analyze workforce data and identify areas for improvement. By calculating relevant measures such as gender distribution, employee turnover rates, promotion rates, and performance ratings, I provided meaningful insights to guide the development of effective diversity and inclusion strategies.


This project allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in leveraging Power BI and other digital tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and problem-solving within Business Services. By combining technical skills with a keen understanding of client needs, I contributed to our organization's digital transformation journey, enabling data-driven decision-making and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.üîçüìä
